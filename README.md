## bosch-smart-home-bridge adapter for ioBroker

This adapter allows to communicate with Bosch Smart Home devices. 
To achieve that it uses the [bosch-smart-home-bridge](https://github.com/holomekc/bosch-smart-home-bridge) library.

Still work in progress. Feedback appreciated.

## Install

The build directory is not part of github but is only part of npm package.
Therefore, you cannot install it via github in ioBroker. Do the following:

* Install from URL
* Custom and just enter: iobroker.bshb
